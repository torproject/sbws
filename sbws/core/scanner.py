    It starts a loop that will be run while there is not and event signaling
    that sbws is stopping (because of SIGTERM or SIGINT).

    Then, it starts a second loop with an ordered list (generator) of relays
    to measure that might a subset of all the current relays in the Network.

    For every relay, it starts a new thread which runs ``measure_relay`` to
    measure the relay until there are ``max_pending_results`` threads.
    After that, it will reuse a thread that has finished for every relay to
    measure.
    It is the the pool method ``apply_async`` which starts or reuse a thread.
    This method returns an ``ApplyResult`` immediately, which has a ``ready``
    methods that tells whether the thread has finished or not.

    When the thread finish, ie. ``ApplyResult`` is ``ready``, it triggers
    ``result_putter`` callback, which put the ``Result`` in ``ResultDump``
    queue and complete immediately.

    ``ResultDump`` thread (started before and out of this function) will get
    the ``Result`` from the queue and write it to disk, so this doesn't block
    the measurement threads.

    If there was an exception not catched by ``measure_relay``, it will call
    instead ``result_putter_error``, which logs the error and complete
    immediately.

    Before iterating over the next relay, it waits (non blocking, since it
    happens in the main thread) until one of the ``max_pending_results``
    threads has finished.

    This is not needed, since otherwise async_result will queue the relays to
    measure in order and won't start reusing a thread to measure a relay until
    other thread has finished. But it makes the logic a bit more sequential.

    Before the outer loop iterates, it also waits (again non blocking) that all
    the ``Results`` are ready.
    This avoid to start measuring the same relay which might still being
    measured.
