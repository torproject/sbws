# Minimum and maximum number of bytes a scanner is allowed to request from a

# happens to require an sbws major version bump.
#
# Note for smart people and people who pull out Wireshark: Even if the scanner
# requests 1 byte, that request and the 1 byte response will each be carried
# over the Internet in 514 byte Tor cells. Theoretically we could bump the
# minimum request size up to ~498 bytes, but I see no reason why we should.
# Trying to hit the maximum cell size just makes sbws server send more, us read
# more, and it runs the risk of standards changing underneath us and sbws
# suddenly creating more than one cell.
