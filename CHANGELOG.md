## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add support for python 3.7 (#28045 )

## [0.8.0] - 2018-10-08

**Important changes**:

- Implement Torflow scaling/aggregation to be able to substitute Torflow with
  sbws without affecting the bandwidth files results.
- Change stem dependency to 1.7.0, which removes the need for `dependency_links``
- Update and cleanup documentation

### Added

- Add system physical requirements section to INSTALL (#26937)
- Warn when there is not enough disk space (#26937)
- Implement Torflow scaling (#27108)
- Create methods to easy graph generation and obtain statistics
  to compare with current torflow results.(#27688)
- Implement rounding bw in bandwidth files to 2 insignificant digits(#27337)
- Filter results in order to include relays in the bandwidth file that:(#27338)
  - have at least two measured bandwidths
  - the measured bandwidths are within 24 hours of each other
  - have at least two descriptor observed bandwidths
  - the descriptor observed bandwidths are within 24 hours of each other

### Fixed

- Broken environment variable in default sbws config. To use envvar $FOO, write
  $$FOO in the config.
- Stop using directory as argument in integration tests (#27342)
- Fix typo getting configuration option to allow logging to file (#27960)
- Set int type to new arguments that otherwise would be string (#27918)
- Stop printing arguments default values, since they are printed by default
  (#27916)
- Use dash instead of underscore in new cli argument names (#27917)

### Changed

- sbws install doc is confusing (#27341)
  - Include system and Python dependencies in `INSTALL`.
  - Include dependencies for docs and tests in `INSTALL`.
  - Point to `DEPLOY` to run sbws.
  - Remove obsolete sections in `INSTALL`
  - Simplify `DEPLOY`, reuse terms in the `glossary`.
  - Remove obsolete ``sbws init`` from `DEPLOY`.
  - Point to config documentation.
  - Add, unify and reuse terms in `glossary`.
- refactor v3bwfile (#27386): move scaling method inside class
- use custom ``install_command`` to test installation commands while
  ``dependency_links`` is needed until #26914 is fixed. (#27704)
- documentation cleanup (#27773)
  - split, merge, simplify, extend, reorganize sections and files
- generate scales as Torflow by default (#27976)
- Replace stem ``dependency_links`` by stem 1.7.0 (#27705). This also eliminates
  the need for custom ``install_command`` in tox.

## [0.7.0] - 2018-08-09

**Important changes**:

- `cleanup/stale_days` is renamed to `cleanup/data_files_compress_after_days`
- `cleanup/rotten_days` is renamed to `cleanup/data_files_delete_after_days`
- sbws now takes as an argument the path to a config file (which contains
  `sbws_home`) instead of `sbws_home` (which contains the path to a config
file)

### Added

- Log line on start up with sbws version, platform info, and library versions
(trac#26751)
- Manual pages (#26926)

### Fixed

- Stop deleting the latest.v3bw symlink. Instead, do an atomic rename.
  (#26740)
- State file for storing the last time `sbws scanner` was started, and able to
  be used for storing many other types of state in the future. (GH#166)
- Log files weren't rotating. Now they are. (#26881)

### Changed

- Remove test data v3bw file and generate it from the same test. (#26736)
- Stop using food terms for cleanup-related config options
- Cleanup command now cleans up old v3bw files too (#26701)
- Make sbws more compatible with system packages: (#26862)
  - Allow a configuration file argument
  - Remove directory argument
  - Create minimal user configuration when running
  - Do not require to run a command to initialize
  - Initialize directories when running
  - Do not require configuration file inside directories specified by the
    configuration

## [0.6.0] - 2018-07-11

**Important changes**:

- The way users configure logging has changed. No longer are most users
  expected to be familiar with how to configure python's standard logging
library with a config file. Instead we've abstracted out the setting of log
level, format, and destinations to make these settings more accessible to
users. Expert users familiar with [the logging config file format][logconffmt]
can still make tweaks.

Summary of changes:

- Make logging configuration easier for the user.
- Add UML diagrams to documentation. They can be found in docs/source/images/
  and regenerated with `make umlsvg` in docs/.

[logconffmt]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-fileformat

### Added

- UML diagrams to documentation. In docs/ run `make umlsvg` to rebuild them.
  Requires graphviz to be installed.(GHPR#226)
- Add metadata to setup.py, useful for source/binary distributions.
- Add possibility to log to system log. (#26683)
- Add option to cleanup v3bw files. (#26701)

### Fixed

- Measure relays that have both Exit and BadExit as non-exits, which is how
  clients would use them. (GH#217)
- Could not init sbws because of a catch-22 related to logging configuration.
  Overhaul how logging is configured. (GH#186 GHPR#224)
- Call write method of V3BWFile class from the object instance. (#26671)
- Stop calculating median on empty list .(#26666)

### Changed

- Remove is_controller_ok. Instead catch possible controller exceptions and
log them

### Removed

- Two parsing/plotting scripts in scripts/tools/ that can now be found at
<https://github.com/pastly/v3bw-tools>

## [0.5.0] - 2018-06-26

**Important changes**:

- Result format changed, causing a version bump to 4. Updating sbws to 0.5.0
  will cause it to ignore results with version less than 4.

Summary of changes:

- Keep previously-generated v3bw files
- Allow a relay to limit its weight based on
  RelayBandwidthRate/MaxAdvertisedBandwidth
- 1 CPU usage optimization
- 1 memory usage optimization

### Added

- Use a relay's {,Relay}BandwidthRate/MaxAdvertisedBandwidth as an upper bound
  on the measurements we make for it. (GH#155)
- Ability to only consider results for a given relay valid if they came from
  when that relay is using its most recent known IP address. Thanks Juga.
(GH#154 GHPR#199)
- Maintenance script to help us find functions that are (probably) no longer
  being called.
- Integration test(s) for RelayPrioritizer (GHPR#206)
- Git/GitHub usage guidelines to CONTRIBUTING document (GH#208 GHPR#215)

### Fixed

- Make relay priority calculations take only ~5% of the time they used to (3s
  vs 60s) by using sets instead of lists when selecting non-Authority relays.
(GH#204)
- Make relay list refreshing take much less time by not allowing worker threads
  to dogpile on the CPU. Before they would all start requesting descriptors
from Tor at roughly the same time, causing us to overload our CPU core and make
the process take unnecessarily long. Now we let one thread do the work so it
can peg the CPU on its own and get the refresh done ASAP.
(GH#205)
- Catch a JSON decode exception on malformed results so sbws can continue
  gracefully (GH#210 GHPR#212)

### Changed

- Change the path where the Bandwidth List files are generated: now they are
  stored in `v3bw` directory, named `YYmmdd_HHMMSS.v3bw`, and previously
generated ones are kept. A `latest.v3bw` symlink is updated. (GH#179 GHPR#190)
- Code refactoring in the v3bw classes and generation area
- Replace v3bw-into-xy bash script with python script to handle a more complex
  v3bw file format (GH#182)

## [0.4.1] - 2018-06-14

### Changed

- If the relay to measure is an exit, put it in the exit position and choose a
  non-exit to help. Previously the relay to measure would always be the first
hop. (GH#181)
- Try harder to find a relay to help measure the target relay with two changes.
  Essentially: (1) Instead of only picking from relays that are 1.25 - 2.00
times faster than it by consensus weight, try (in order) to find a relay that
is at least 2.00, 1.75, 1.50, 1.25, or 1.00 times as fast. If that fails,
instead of giving up, (2) pick the fastest relay in the network instead of
giving up. This compliments the previous change about measuring target exits in
the exit position.

### Fixed

- Exception that causes sbws to fall back to one measurement thread. We first
  tried fixing something in this area with `88fae60bc` but neglected to
remember that `.join()` wants only string arguments and can't handle a `None`.
So fix that.
- Exception when failing to get a relay's `ed25519_master_key` from Tor and
  trying to do `.rstrip()` on a None.
- `earliest_bandwidth` being the newest bw not the oldest (thanks juga0)
- `node_id` was missing the character "$" at the beginning
