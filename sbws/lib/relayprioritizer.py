# ~6500 relays and with a ResultDump containing 1 result per relay, the
# best_priority() function takes ~11 seconds to complete on my home desktop.
# Using this parameter allows us to balance between calling best_priority()
# more often (but wasting more CPU), and calling it less often (but taking
# longer to get back to relays with non-successful results).
#
# Alternatively, we could rewrite best_priority() to not suck so much.

# penality reduces freshness more, therefore the relay's priority will be
# better, therefore we'll measure it again sooner.

        NOTE: A lower value for priority means better priority. Remember your
        data structures class in university and consider this something like a
        min-priority queue.

        Priority is calculated as the sum of the "freshness" of each
        result for a relay. First we determine <oldest_allowed>, the time at
        which we stop considering results to be valid. From there, a result's
        freshness is determined to be the amount of time between when the
        measurement was made and <oldest_allowed>. Therefore, you should see
        that a measurement made more recently will have a higher freshness.

        We adjust down the freshness for results containing errors. If we
        ignored errors and didn't increase a relay's priority value for them,
        then we'll get stuck trying to measure a few relays that have the best
        priority but are having issues getting measured. If we treated errors
        with equal weight as successful results, then it would take a while to
        get around to giving the relay another chance at a getting a successful
        measurement.
