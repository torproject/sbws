class State:

    """
    State allows one to atomically access and update a simple state file on
    disk across threads and across processes.

    To put it blunty, due to limited developer time and his inability to
    quickly find a way to safely access and update more complex data types
    (namely, collections like list, set, and dict), you may only store simple
    types of data as enumerated in _ALLOWED_TYPES. Keys must be strings.

    Data is stored as JSON on disk in the provided file file.

    >>> state = State('foo.state')
    >>> # state == {}

    >>> state['linux'] = True
    >>> # 'foo.state' now exists on disk with the JSON for {'linux': True}

    >>> # We read 'foo.state' from disk in order to get the most up-to-date
    >>> #     state info. Pretend another process has updated 'linux' to be
    >>> #     False
    >>> state['linux']
    >>> # returns False

    >>> # Pretend another process has added the user's age to the state file.
    >>> #     As before, we read the state file from disk for the most
    >>> #     up-to-date info.
    >>> state['age']
    >>> # Returns 14

    >>> # We now set their name. We read the state file first, set the option,
    >>> #     and then write it out.
    >>> state['name'] = 'John'

    >>> # We can do many of the same things with a State object as with a dict
    >>> for key in state: print(key)
    >>> # Prints 'linux', 'age', and 'name'
