        Obtain final bandwidth measurements applying Torflow's scaling
        method.

        From Torflow's README.spec.txt (section 2.2)::

            In this way, the resulting network status consensus bandwidth values  # NOQA
            are effectively re-weighted proportional to how much faster the node  # NOQA
            was as compared to the rest of the network.

        The variables and steps used in Torflow:

        **strm_bw**::

            The strm_bw field is the average (mean) of all the streams for the relay  # NOQA
            identified by the fingerprint field.
            strm_bw = sum(bw stream x)/|n stream|

        **filt_bw**::

            The filt_bw field is computed similarly, but only the streams equal to  # NOQA
            or greater than the strm_bw are counted in order to filter very slow  # NOQA
            streams due to slow node pairings.

        **filt_sbw and strm_sbw**::

            for rs in RouterStats.query.filter(stats_clause).\
                  options(eagerload_all('router.streams.circuit.routers')).all():  # NOQA
              tot_sbw = 0
              sbw_cnt = 0
              for s in rs.router.streams:
                if isinstance(s, ClosedStream):
                  skip = False
                  #for br in badrouters:
                  #  if br != rs:
                  #    if br.router in s.circuit.routers:
                  #      skip = True
                  if not skip:
                    # Throw out outliers < mean
                    # (too much variance for stddev to filter much)
                    if rs.strm_closed == 1 or s.bandwidth() >= rs.sbw:
                      tot_sbw += s.bandwidth()
                      sbw_cnt += 1

            if sbw_cnt: rs.filt_sbw = tot_sbw/sbw_cnt
            else: rs.filt_sbw = None

        **filt_avg, and strm_avg**::

            Once we have determined the most recent measurements for each node, we  # NOQA
            compute an average of the filt_bw fields over all nodes we have measured.  # NOQA

        ::

            filt_avg = sum(map(lambda n: n.filt_bw, nodes.itervalues()))/float(len(nodes))  # NOQA
            strm_avg = sum(map(lambda n: n.strm_bw, nodes.itervalues()))/float(len(nodes))  # NOQA

        **true_filt_avg and true_strm_avg**::

            for cl in ["Guard+Exit", "Guard", "Exit", "Middle"]:
                true_filt_avg[cl] = filt_avg
                true_strm_avg[cl] = strm_avg

        In the non-pid case, all types of nodes get the same avg

        **n.fbw_ratio and n.fsw_ratio**::

            for n in nodes.itervalues():
                n.fbw_ratio = n.filt_bw/true_filt_avg[n.node_class()]
                n.sbw_ratio = n.strm_bw/true_strm_avg[n.node_class()]

        **n.ratio**::

            These averages are used to produce ratios for each node by dividing the  # NOQA
            measured value for that node by the network average.

        ::

            # Choose the larger between sbw and fbw
              if n.sbw_ratio > n.fbw_ratio:
                n.ratio = n.sbw_ratio
              else:
                n.ratio = n.fbw_ratio

        **desc_bw**:

        It is the minimum of all the descriptor bandwidth values::

            bws = map(int, g)
            bw_observed = min(bws)

            return Router(ns.idhex, ns.nickname, bw_observed, dead, exitpolicy,
            ns.flags, ip, version, os, uptime, published, contact, rate_limited,  # NOQA
            ns.orhash, ns.bandwidth, extra_info_digest, ns.unmeasured)

            self.desc_bw = max(bw,1) # Avoid div by 0

        **new_bw**::

            These ratios are then multiplied by the most recent observed descriptor  # NOQA
            bandwidth we have available for each node, to produce a new value for  # NOQA
            the network status consensus process.

        ::

            n.new_bw = n.desc_bw*n.ratio

        The descriptor observed bandwidth is multiplied by the ratio.

        **Limit the bandwidth to a maximum**::

            NODE_CAP = 0.05

        ::

            if n.new_bw > tot_net_bw*NODE_CAP:
              plog("INFO", "Clipping extremely fast "+n.node_class()+" node "+n.idhex+"="+n.nick+  # NOQA
                   " at "+str(100*NODE_CAP)+"% of network capacity ("+
                   str(n.new_bw)+"->"+str(int(tot_net_bw*NODE_CAP))+") "+
                   " pid_error="+str(n.pid_error)+
                   " pid_error_sum="+str(n.pid_error_sum))
              n.new_bw = int(tot_net_bw*NODE_CAP)

        However, tot_net_bw does not seems to be updated when not using pid.
        This clipping would make faster relays to all have the same value.

        All of that can be expressed as:

        .. math::

           bwn_i =& min\\left(bwnew_i,
