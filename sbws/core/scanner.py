    measure the relay until there are ``max_pending_results`` threads.

    It is the the pool method ``apply_async`` which starts or reuse a thread.

    methods that tells whether the thread has finished or not.

    When the thread finish, ie. ``ApplyResult`` is ``ready``, it triggers
    ``result_putter`` callback, which put the ``Result`` in ``ResultDump``

    ``ResultDump`` thread (started before and out of this function) will get
    the ``Result`` from the queue and write it to disk, so this doesn't block

    Before the outer loop iterates, it waits (non blocking) that all

    While there are relays being measured, just log the progress
    and sleep :const:`~sbws.globals.TIMEOUT_MEASUREMENTS` (3mins),
    which is aproximately the time it can take to measure a relay in
    the worst case.

    When there has not been any relay measured in ``TIMEOUT_MEASUREMENTS``
    and there are still relays pending to be measured, it means there is no
    progress and call :func:`~sbws.core.scanner.force_get_results`.

    This can happen in the case of a bug that makes either
    :func:`~sbws.core.scanner.measure_relay`,
    :func:`~sbws.core.scanner.result_putter` (callback) and/or
    :func:`~sbws.core.scanner.result_putter_error` (callback error) stall.

    .. note:: in a future refactor, this could be simpler by:

      1. Initializing the pool at the begingging of each loop
      2. Callling :meth:`~Pool.close`; :meth:`~Pool.join` after
         :meth:`~Pool.apply_async`,
         to ensure no new jobs are added until the pool has finished with all
         the ones in the queue.

      As currently, there would be still two cases when the pool could stall:

      1. There's an exception in ``measure_relay`` and another in
         ``callback_err``
      2. There's an exception ``callback``.

      This could also be simpler by not having callback and callback error in
      ``apply_async`` and instead just calling callback with the
      ``pending_results``.

      (callback could be also simpler by not having a thread and queue and
      just storing to disk, since the time to write to disk is way smaller
      than the time to request over the network.)
