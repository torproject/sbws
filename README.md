Simple Bandwidth Scanner (called `sbws`) is a Tor bandwidth scanner that
generates bandwidth files to be used by Directory Authorities.

The scanner measures the bandwidth of each relay in the Tor network
(except the directory authorities) by creating a two hops circuit
with the relay. It then measures the bandwidth by downloading data
from a destination Web Server and stores the measurements.

The generator read the measurements, aggregates, filters and
scales them using torflow's scaling method.
Then it generates a bandwidth list file that is read
by a directory authority to report relaysâ€™ bandwidth in its vote.

**WARNING**: This software is intended to be run by researchers using a test
Tor network, such as chutney or shadow, or by the Tor bandwidth authorities
on the public Tor network.
Please do not run this software on the public Tor network unless you are one
of the Tor bandwidth authorities, to avoid creating unnecessary traffic.

**ADVICE**: It is recommended to read this documentation at
[Read the Docs](https://sbws.rtfd.io). In
[Github](https://github.com/torproject/sbws) some links won't be properly
rendered.
It can also be read after installing the Debian package ``sbws-doc`` in
``/usr/share/doc/sbws`` or after building it locally as explained in
``./docs/source/documenting.rst``.
